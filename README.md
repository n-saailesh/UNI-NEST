üè°UNI-NEST: Student Residence Finder A platform that helps students find a suitable residence based on their specific preferences‚Äîbuilt to emphasize the significance of UX Journey/Service and Design.

‚ú®Inspiration This project was inspired by one of my own challenges. When my friend and I were near completing my first year of university, we slowly realized that I needed to find a place to live in for my second year and moving forward. Frankly, we were searching all these different websites and estate rentals platforms to find an apartment, and it was not easy. One problem that was continuously faced was that none of these known rental platforms was student-focused. Students are going to have different needs compared to other regular citizens in the city; for instance, the distance between home and school, the roommates, the noise levels, the rent amount, types of contracts, and more. While we were doing this challenge, we were also taking this course, UX Strategy, and we decided that our entire project for this course was inspired by this challenge. After finding a few other students from different fields of study, but with the same problem, we used this challenge to demonstrate a solution that also demonstrated to students the importance of UX Journey/Service and Design. We used the Design Thinking Process (Empathize, Define, Brainstorm, Ideate, Test, Prototype). There were three deliverables, and each deliverable was responsible for a few steps of the UX thinking process. After receiving the insightful feedback for each deliverable, we created a high-fidelity prototype of our platform UNI-NEST using Figma.

With the permission of my colleagues, I created a website based off our high-fidelity prototype. I used project-based learning to learn the web development languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, used in this project. All in all, this was a great opportunity to showcase my skill. My goal for this website is to hopefully help students avoid the same challenge I came across when finding my new home.

‚ùìHow does this promote the importance of UX Journey/Service and Design? With the users‚Äô feedback, we brainstormed ideas on how to better convey the idea of journey/service design in UX. With the ideation, we decided that an application to help students find residence would better convey the importance of the concept. We created a low-fidelity prototype.

However, users found the chats‚Äô questions to be repetitive at some tendency; thus, we created an option using our Journey/Service Design knowledge in UX to lessen the repetition by allowing users to create an account. It was implemented into the high-fidelity prototype, and users

found the feature to make the journey process less tendency and more. This helps students understand how service design can be used to understand the struggles of an application, but also how journey design can be used to better improve it.
